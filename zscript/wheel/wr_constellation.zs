// THE STAR CHART.
//
// Your arsenal drawn the way a chart draws a sky: every weapon is a named
// five-pointed star, every slot is a constellation with its own colour and its
// own cloud of coloured dust, and thin lines run from each star to the ones it
// belongs with.
//
// IT DRAWS ITSELF, STARTING FROM WHAT YOU ARE HOLDING. The gun in your hands
// lights first, lines drop from it to its variants, then a line reaches across
// to the next slot and that constellation builds in turn. The reveal is the
// only moment the chart gets to explain itself, and it explains best by
// starting somewhere the player already is.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE RING. The ring is an arc, and an arc runs out
// of arc length -- that is why sub-cards, fans, wr_subcards_max and the whole
// crowding apparatus exist at all. A volume does not run out. A fifty-weapon
// arsenal is a bigger sky, not a more crowded one, so the chart needs none of
// that machinery and does not have it.
//
// WHAT IT IS MADE OF.
//
//   stars    BB_SDFSTAR, a payload written for this. A star POLYGON, hollow
//            with a stroke for the named ones and solid for the dust, so the
//            whole chart is one shape at three sizes.
//   labels   BB_TEXT, centred INSIDE its star. That is the entire reason the
//            star had to be a glyph with a middle rather than a point of
//            light: a point of light has nowhere to write.
//   links    the volumetric beams. This is the best use that feature has had
//            here -- the lines between stars ARE lasers, and each one grows
//            from its parent toward its child rather than appearing whole.
//
// THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE, having tried them: a horizontal
// reference ring on the floor, drop lines from every star down to it, a bloom
// disc behind each star, and a spinning selection reticle. Every one of them
// was borrowed from a different kind of diagram, and together they buried the
// thing they were supposed to clarify. A chart is stars, names and lines.
//
// NOTHING IS FROZEN HERE. Stopping the world while the chart is up is the
// caller's business, not this file's.

	// across three other stars as soon as you turn your head. Pushing every

	//
	// YOU CAN STILL PHYSICALLY MOVE WITH THE WORLD FROZEN, so you should be
	// able to put your hand on a star. The ring solves the same problem with a
	// fixed fingertip extension, and that answer does not carry: its cards all
	// sit at one distance, so one frozen offset parks the fingertip just short
	// of all of them. A sky does not have one distance -- these stars are
	// spread from forty-six units to a hundred and twenty, deliberately,
	// because the spread IS the parallax.
	//
	// So the extension is EARNED rather than fixed. This is go-go: inside a
	// dead zone the fingertip is exactly your hand and nothing is changed, and
	// past it the virtual reach grows with the SQUARE of how far you have
	// actually pushed. A small deliberate extension therefore travels a long
	// way out, while ordinary hand movement near your body does not move the
	// fingertip at all -- which is the property that stops this from firing
	// while you are simply holding the controller.
	//
	// Measured from the EYE, along the eye-to-hand line, and both halves of
	// that matter. Live eye rather than the frozen origin, so leaning your
	// whole body toward a constellation reaches it. And the eye-to-hand line
	// rather than the hand's own forward axis, because reaching into a volume
	// is done with the ARM: you put your arm toward the star and push along

	// lighting up is feedback enough. Out here the fingertip is thirty metres
	// away in a volume; with nothing rendered you would be reaching blind into
	// a sky and guessing. A small solid star, the same glyph as everything

	//
	// BBFL_NODEPTH ON EVERYTHING, and it is the whole answer.
	//

	// still selectable, because nothing in the pointing path knows geometry
	// exists -- AimBillboard, TouchBillboard and stickPick all pass straight
	// through it. You end up pointing a clamped laser at a star behind a door
	// and committing to it blind.
	//
	// The first attempt traced at build and pulled each cluster in to fit the
	// room. It worked, and it was WRONG: a Doom room is often two hundred units
	// across and this chart wants to stand at a hundred and twenty, so the
	// clamp crushed the sky into a closet and took every bit of the depth and
	// spread the layout exists for with it.
	//
	// The mismatch was never that the PLACEMENT disobeyed walls. It was that
	// the DRAWING obeyed them while the pointing did not. A chart is a menu
	// that happens to occupy a volume, not an object in the room -- so it draws
	// over geometry, the two halves agree again, and it stands as far out as it
	// likes. wr_gunhud.zs uses the flag for the on-gun readout for the same
	// reason.
	//
	// The beams are the one exception, and they have no choice: SetBeam has no
	// depth flag. The links between stars and the leaders out to the names will
	// still be cut by a wall. They are the least load-bearing thing here -- the
	// stars, the names and the titles all draw through.

	// Beam slots 0 and 1 belong to RS_GrabViz, which says so in its own header
