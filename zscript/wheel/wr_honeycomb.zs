// THE HONEYCOMB.
//
// Every weapon you own, all at once, as a wall of hexagonal cells packed
// edge to edge and coloured by slot.
//
// WHY IT SHOWS EVERYTHING. The ring folds weapons into fans for exactly one
// reason, stated in its own source: an arc runs out of arc length, and nine
// cards need nine card-widths of it at a radius nobody wants. A packed grid
// has no such ceiling -- ring 3 holds 37 cells, ring 4 holds 61 -- so the
// crowding valve that fans exist to be is not needed here, and carrying it
// over would be importing a workaround for a constraint that is absent.
//
// WHAT THAT BUYS, beyond not hiding anything: a slot becomes a CONTIGUOUS
// PATCH OF ONE COLOUR. Four shotguns read as four shotguns at a glance,
// without hovering, without opening anything. The grouping is spatial and
// permanent rather than a thing you have to go and unfold -- which is the one
// job the fan never actually did well.
//
// HOVER BLOOMS THE WHOLE SLOT rather than re-tiling. The image this was drawn
// from had cells sliding apart to admit new ones, and it is a lovely moment,
// but it costs a re-solve of the entire comb mid-motion and it moves the thing
// you were pointing at. Lifting a colour group toward you and dimming the rest
// gives the same beat -- the group announces itself -- while every cell stays
// exactly where your hand already learned it was.
//
// The cells are BB_SDFHEX, which was added to the engine for this: a
// tessellation shares edges, and a shared edge is the one place a sampled
// shape cannot hide. Two neighbours each half a pixel soft do not meet, they
// seam.
//
// IT IS A SPHERE SECTION, NOT A WALL -- a flattened soccerball, which is what
// it was asked to be and also what makes it work. The cells are laid out in
// ANGLE around your eye rather than in distance across a plane, so each one
// subtends the same angle wherever it sits and the comb stays exactly
// tessellated at its edges instead of opening up. Every cell faces you
// (BBF_CAMERA), which on a sphere centred on your eye is the same statement
// twice.

	// and THAT is the distance two horizontal neighbours must sit apart to

	// units across and this chart wants to stand at a hundred and twenty: the
	// clamp crushed the sky into a closet, and every bit of depth and spread
